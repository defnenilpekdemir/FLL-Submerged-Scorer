# FLL Submerged Scorer

A lightweight and user-friendly scoring interface for the **FIRST® LEGO® League 2024/25 season: Submerged**.

Built entirely with Python using the `tkinter` library, this local desktop tool allows referees, teams, and mentors to calculate scores quickly and accurately — no browser, no internet, and no installation needed beyond Python itself.

## Why This Project?

Official FLL score sheets are often static and require manual calculation or third-party platforms.  
This project offers a **fully offline, intuitive, and mission-accurate scorer** tailored specifically for the 2024/25 season.

It's ideal for:
- Teams practicing at home or at events  
- Mentors needing a quick scoring simulation  
- Referees looking for a fast, no-hassle tool  

---

## How It Works

- Interactive desktop interface with mission checkboxes  
- Each mission's value is based on the official FLL rulebook  
- Real-time score updates with each selection  
- Fully standalone — runs as a single `.py` file  
- No dependencies or frameworks needed  

---

## Tech Stack

- Python 3.x  
- Tkinter (built-in GUI module)
