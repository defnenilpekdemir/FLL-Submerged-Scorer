# FLL-Submerged-Scorer

An interactive scoring system tailored for the **FIRSTÂ® LEGOÂ® League 2024/25 season: Submerged**.  
Built entirely with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript to provide a fast, local, and accessible solution for referees, teams, and developers.

## Problem Statement

Official FLL score sheets are often static and require manual calculation or third-party tools.  
This project addresses the need for a **fully local, intuitive, and mission-accurate scorer** that works directly in the browser â€” without any dependencies, internet access, or installations.

## How It Works

- Dynamically calculates total score based on selected missions
- Interface mirrors the 2024/25 Submerged mission rulebook
- Pure JavaScript DOM manipulation handles real-time updates
- Lightweight and beginner-friendly

## Tech Stack

- HTML â€“ layout and structure  
- CSS â€“ styling and responsiveness  
- JavaScript â€“ logic and interactivity

ðŸ‘‰ Runs directly by opening `index.html` in any browser. No installation required.
